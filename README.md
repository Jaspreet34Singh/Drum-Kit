Drum Kit Simulation
**Project Overview**
The Drum Kit Simulation is an interactive web project where users can play drum sounds either by pressing designated keys on their keyboard or by clicking on the on-screen drum images. This project was created as part of a web development course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu to practice and showcase the use of JavaScript event listeners for creating responsive and interactive web applications.

**Features**
Keyboard Interaction: Press specific keys to trigger different drum sounds.
Clickable Drums: Click on the drum images to play corresponding sounds.
Audio Feedback: Instant sound response for an engaging experience.
Simple UI: A user-friendly interface with intuitive controls.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: Structuring the webpage.
CSS: Styling the drum kit layout.
JavaScript: Handling event listeners and audio playback.
How It Works
Each drum image on the screen is linked to a unique sound. By pressing the associated key or clicking the image, an event listener triggers an audio file to play, creating an interactive and fun drumming experience.

**Future Enhancements**
Visual Effects: Add animations when a drum is played using setTimeout() function.
Custom Sound Upload: Allow users to upload their own drum sounds.
